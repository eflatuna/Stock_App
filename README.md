## Formik and Yup
Formik simplifies form handling in React, allowing for easy state management, form validation, and error handling. Yup is a schema-based validation library, often used with Formik for defining form validation rules.

### Advantages of Formik
- **Form State Management**: Manages form state, including field values and errors.
- **Error Handling**: Formik provides easy handling of error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Form Submission**: Simplifies form submission to the server.
- **Helper Functions**: Offers useful helper functions for form handling, such as resetting and clearing fields.

### Yup Features
- **Schema-Based Validation**: Define validation rules for form fields.
- **Custom Validation**: Supports custom validation functions and messages.
- **Error Handling**: Generates error messages for invalid inputs.


## Redux Persist
Redux Persist enables data persistence in Redux-based applications, allowing Redux store data to persist across page reloads or application restarts. This is achieved by saving Redux state in local storage or other storage solutions.

## Axios Instance and Interceptors
Axios is a popular HTTP client for making requests. An Axios instance allows you to define a base URL and default headers for requests. Interceptors are functions that run before or after a request/response, useful for adding authorization tokens or handling errors.

## Promise.all() in Axios
Promise.all() allows you to execute multiple promises simultaneously and wait for all of them to complete before proceeding. It's useful for making concurrent Axios requests.
